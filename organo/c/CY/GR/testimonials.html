               	<div id="quotes">
                <p>"As an entrepreneur most of my life I have been involved in several different types of businesses, including several network marketing businesses. Since my past experiences were never positive (or I should say never beneficial) I was pretty set against joining another MLM. Organo Gold has changed my whole perception and for many different reasons. The benefits that it offers people is amazing. I see it as a win-win situation for myself and for all the people that I have the potential to reach. I am very excited to be a part of this company." <strong>– Jose L.</strong></p>
			    <p>"I never liked green tea before no matter what brand I tried, but I love Organo Gold Green Tea. I used to buy mochas from speciality coffee shops, but Organo Gold Mocha is every bit as delicious." <strong>– Holly H., Victoria, BC, Canada</strong></p>
			    <p>"I was introduced to Organo Gold by my sponsor, Theresa H, and was very skeptical. I am someone that would have never tried this product on my own. I decided to try it and drank it every day for a week. I seemed to have more energy every day and definitely would say that something was happening to my body. Just an over all feeling of "well-being." I am sold, and now I am on a mission to tell anyone that will listen what a difference it could make in their lives. I have a Latte in the morning and drink the Green Tea throughout the day. Thank you OG, Feeling Good! Looking Good!" <strong>– Nancy R., Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada</strong></p>

			    <p>"I am Organo Gold's number one fan! I love Ganoderma and since I've started taking it I've been unstoppable. I've never had so much energy… People think I'm in my 20's and not 40's. I want everyone to feel this good everyday!" <strong>– Anne B., Nanaimo, BC, Canada</strong></p>
			    <p>"The OG products we've taken have helped improve our concentration at work. We feel better overall and more alert." <strong>– Shane and Jessica V., Pueblo, Colorado</strong></p>
			    <p>"Since I have been drinking Organo Gold coffee I've experienced less stress and better general health. I have been on the product for over six weeks and feel great." <strong>– Bob P., Magnolia, Texas</strong></p>
			    <p>"We love the taste of OG coffee! We have more energy, we sleep better than ever before and wake up refreshed. Our family loves this business and we ALL can do things that generate coffee income! The timing couldn't be more perfect for Organo Gold." <strong>– Miles &amp; Jackie A. Family, Magnolia, Texas</strong></p>

			    <p>"I have started to take the capsules once a day and can't believe the energy I have! I work in the front lines of an acute care hospital and I truly believe that the benefits of ganoderma will help me stay healthy to handle whatever Mother Nature throws my way!" <strong>– Nadeane Nelson, Regina, SK, Canada</strong></p>
			    <p>"I've been drinking the OG black coffee since February 2009 and love it! If you are looking for a true black coffee experience, this drink is for you. It is a must try for any coffee fan." <strong>– Pat Wagman, Regina, SK, Canada</strong></p>
			    <p>"I couldn't imagine drinking "instant" coffee after drinking brewed coffee for years, but OG coffee is great. After a couple of cups I was completely hooked! Organo Gold coffee is the only coffee that I will now drink. I take some everywhere I go. I hope everyone tries these products." <strong>– Heather K., Calgary, AB, Canada</strong></p>
			    <p>"I am so grateful for Organo Gourmet Coffee and the New Hybrid Compensation Plan that rewards everyone. Drinking Ganoderma Coffee will improve my life in many ways. I am committed to sharing this message of wellness. Organo Gold has truly brought everyone a gift of nature, and an opportunity with excellent compensation."<strong> – P.L. Washington State</strong></p>

			    <p>"Organo Gold is first class. I would be proud to take this to the White House, the Vatican, the best five-star restaurant, or even other coffee shops. The product is a true treasure. I realize I have the responsibility to help change lives and I can do that with Organo Gold. This is not a hope so, it's a know so!" – A.B.</p>
			    <p>"The Organo Gold business plan is the best. And so are the people. Thank you OG!"<strong> – Pam T.</strong></p>
